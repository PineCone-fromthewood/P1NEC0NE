			<br>
			<br>
			Tell me how long are we suppose to act like this? <br>
			We won't never get on track like this <br>
			How can I ever tell you how I feel if you react like this? <br>
			You call me over here to talk and I get attacked like this <br>
			It's funny <br>
			Got your track shoes on but what you running from <br>
			Shit I know where you going and where you coming from <br>
			That’s immaturity showing, its just the baby in you <br>
			One of the reasons why I never put a baby in you <br>
			Tired of hearing how you’ll never trust me again <br>
			How you love me, then you hate me, then you love me again <br>
			One minute I’m your soul-mate then it’s fuck me again <br>
			Until you get horny enough and wan' fuck me again, but check it <br>
			I just wan' treat you good and do better <br>
			You think I’m running round tryna be the hood's Hugh Heffner <br>
			Say I’m all about hoes, when I’m all about you <br>
			Even when I’m with my hoes, I tell them all about you <br>
			Say that’s just one reason I keep losing you <br>
			I don’t understand it, that shit is confusing too <br>
			You left me, I’m doing me, you doing you <br>
			So what the fuck is me doing me have to do witchu? <br>
			How dare you tell me it's tougher for you? <br>
			Like I don’t hear about them niggas you fucking with too? <br>
			I'd never knew you thought like that (dammit) <br>
			Who knew you was into sports like that <br>
			More prayers because they all players <br>
			You out there having a ball, player, ball player after ball player <br>
			I mean you with the ball players more than ball players <br>
			Hope they ain't fucking you and making you they ball-player <br>
			Come to me, I just get a hard time <br>
			Why they give one to you, is this what you wan' do? <br>
			With me you get an attitude, you get all stuck up <br>
			Start calling me a fuck up till I tell you shut the fuck up <br>
			Yeah, but the part I don’t respect is <br>
			You so cool with every other one of your exes <br>
			It's history between us, all ain't right either <br>
			Back and forth domestic, all ain't flights either <br>
			Be wanting you close to me, supposedly <br>
			You say you over me, that just comes across as a joke to me <br>
			'Cause you ain't got the kind of love that expires <br>
			Worst case, you’ll get tired, tell your friends I'm a liar <br>
			Tried therapy when we felt it going sour <br>
			That’s four-hundred dollars every hour <br>
			For him to come and mediate, referee, be our interpreter <br>
			Tell me I need to lower my voice, don’t curse at her <br>
			Says she’s only frustrated 'cause I keep hurtin' her <br>
			Tell me despite all that, he can tell that I worship her <br>
			Soon as you let your guard down, I get it up again <br>
			Fixing it is too much work, so I give up again <br>
			But I wan' spend the rest of my life with you <br>
			Make a wife with you, make it alright with you <br>
			But how are you ever suppose to think that I’m right for you <br>
			When all I ever do is treat you like a recyclable <br>
			Disgraceful and you want me to chase you <br>
			But it's easier for me to replace you, 'cause I see it like <br>
			If you can't deal with what we go through <br>
			I got bitches lined up, I got a ego too <br>
			And to them I’m everything, funny, I'm great and I’m charming <br>
			But to you I’m alarming, all I do is bring harm in <br>
			To you, I’m the cause of all your misery <br>
			Of course I disagree, you going off our history <br>
			All that arguing just ain't my style <br>
			'Cause that anger now got us like strangers now <br>
			You tell me I should get help and I’m sick in the head <br>
			You found makeup on the sheets, I had a bitch in our bed <br>
			But wait, I ain't love her though, I ain't fuck her though <br>
			I could dead that bitch right now man, fuck that hoe <br>
			You just think I'll get another and another hoe <br>
			Way you talk to me it's like I got a whole club of hoes <br>
			But I could switch gears, make 'em all disappear <br>
			You going through my phone like I got a bitch in there <br>
			We discussing chicks after they through <br>
			They don’t matter to me, but for some reason they matter to you <br>
			We keep having the same threesome <br>
			But not the kind that come as a blessing, nah <br>
			You keep bringing up my last girl like she ain't my past girl <br>
			Like you ain't the reason she present, check it <br>
			You ain't gotta worry about me and her <br>
			If I wanted to be with her I would be with her <br>
			Yeah, we hung together, strip clubs, had fun together <br>
			But that’s done, don't sweat her, uh <br>
			You the only one I wanna do a bid with <br>
			Live with, share my last name, have kids with <br>
			Can't be understated, anytime we ever dated <br>
			You compare me in your head to some nigga you created <br>
			I’m a long way from perfect, I got shit with me <br>
			Still I want you to love me unconditionally <br>
			Nine-years in, I don’t deserve what you giving me <br>
			Like you get a victory by acting like a dick to me <br>
			Want me to see how it feels, I get the trickery <br>
			Lesson learned though, you my missing piece <br>
			Give another chance to your ex <br>
			You don’t pick up the phone, you don’t answer my texts <br>
			Bitch, we ain't give it all that we got <br>
			Still ain't empty the clip, let's give it one more shot <br> 
			Or we can go ahead on our own <br>
			I need you I can’t do this alone <br>
